# BlueHat

While compositional interpretation is the core of language understanding, humans also derive meaning via inference. For example, while the phrase 'the blue hat' introduces a blue hat into the discourse via direct composition of 'blue' and 'hat,' the same discourse entity is introduced by the phrase 'the blue color of this hat' despite the absence of any local composition between 'blue' and 'hat.' Instead, we infer that if the color is blue and it belongs to the hat, the hat must be blue.
